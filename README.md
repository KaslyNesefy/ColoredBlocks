Simple project where you can play match game. Here you can create host and connect to it in local net as client. 

All you need in game is just make grid in blue zone same to grid in red zone by  using blocks from green zone. To pick block you hate to look at it and press E. Use same key when holding block and looking at blue zone grid.
